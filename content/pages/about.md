Most people know me as Max Liu. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the
[Green Group](http://cheme.scripts.mit.edu/green-group/) at MIT. You can learn
more about my professional background on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liumengjie).

I am a first-generation Chinese-American, having moved here with my parents as
a child. I grew up in a quiet suburb of Atlanta, spending my time outside of
school learning piano and playing outside with neighbors.

Math and science were always my favorite subjects in school, mainly because I
found them more interesting and logical compared to language arts or social
studies. Having English as a second language probably contributed in that
regard. This all led to the eventual realization of my interest in chemistry,
and later chemical engineering.

I did my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech, not too far from home. My best
experience during my four years there was the semester I spent studying abroad
at GT Lorraine. That experience really reinforced my love of traveling and
exploring foreign cities. I also finally got a chance to use the bit of French
I learned in high school.

After graduating, I was incredibly excited to realize my dream of attending MIT,
although it was for grad school instead of undergrad as I had originally
envisioned. Nowadays, I spend most of my time on research, but I like to spend
my free time playing piano/violin, cooking/eating, watching TV, and occasionally
sailing during the summer.
