Summary: Welcome!

Welcome to my website! I finally decided to join the personal website trend
and create a web presence for myself. I also thought this would be a good
opportunity to use the CS knowledge I've learned after starting grad school.
Working on developing RMG and RMG-website have made me very comfortable with
using Python, git/GitHub, and command line tools. As such, this website was
built using [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), a Python based static site
generator.

As you've probably noticed, the theme of the website is very chemistry heavy,
but I don't plan on restricting posts to chemistry topics. I also don't know
how often I will post, so we will see as time goes on. It took 7 months from
when I first created the git repository to when I finally launched the site,
mainly due to procrastination. Hopefully that trend doesn't continue with
posts, since creating posts has a much lower activation barrier than setting up
the website.
